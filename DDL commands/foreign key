Foreign key is a column in a table that uniquely identifies each row of another table. That column refers to a primary key of another table. This creates a kind of link between the tables. 

CREATE TABLE customers (customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name TEXT,
second_name TEXT);


CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_number INT,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
     REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
);



INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (1, 'Robert', 'Cursor'),
       (2, 'Julia', 'Loyds'),
       (3, 'Jack', 'Morgten');


INSERT INTO orders (order_id, order_number, customer_id)
VALUES (1, 101, 3),
       (2, 102, 3),
       (3, 103, 2),
       (4, 104, 1);
