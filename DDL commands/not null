A column can include NULL values. A NULL value is a special value that means the value is unknown or does not exist. 

CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column_name type_name NOT NULL,
  ...);


CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_number INT NOT NULL,
customer_id INT,
   FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
     REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
);


INSERT INTO orders (order_number)
VALUES (NULL);
