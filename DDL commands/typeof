n SQLite, there are five primitive data types. They are called storage classes. Here are the details of them:
NULL: The value is a NULL value. NULL values mean missing information or unknown.
INTEGER: The value is a whole number (positive or negative), stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.
REAL: The value is a floating-point value, stored as an 8-byte float. They are real numbers with decimal values.
TEXT: The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
BLOB: BLOB stands for a binary large object that can store any kind of data. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.



SQLite determines the data type of a value based on its data type in accordance with the following rules:
If a value is enclosed by single or double quotes, it is assigned the TEXT storage class.
If a value has no enclosing quotes and decimal point or exponent, it is assigned INTEGER storage class.
If a value has no enclosing quotes, but decimal point or exponent, it is assigned REAL storage class.
If a value is NULL without quotes, it is assigned NULL storage class.
If a value has X'ABCD' or x'abcd', it is assigned BLOB storage class.
